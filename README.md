# Bartender

This Ruby Gem scrapes a list of cocktails and their ingredients from the International Bartenders Association (IBA) and uses a CLI to ask the user which ingredients they have in their own barcart in order to recommend cocktails that they can make themselves.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bartender'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bartender

## Usage

TODO: Type the below and follow the on screen prompts:

bin/bartender

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
